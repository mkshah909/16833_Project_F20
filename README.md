1. Make folder called 'Figures' at the same level as 'Data'.
2. At the beginning of genSimData.m, update filenameSuffix to indicated format and choose whether to save data or not. (setting saveNewData to true makes the data generation and slam algorithm both run slower).
3. Copy the same filenameSuffix to runModel.m and run that file.
